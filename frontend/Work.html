                <h3>1. The Invisible Layer</h3>
                <p>
                    Computers don't "see" images like humans do. They see a grid of numbers. 
                    We take your image (the superficial layer) and add a specifically calculated "digital mist." 
                    To your eyes, the photo looks exactly the same. To an AI, the numbers are now scrambled, 
                    making it impossible to interpret the image content.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>2. Simple vs. Extreme Shield</h3>
                <div class="comparison-table">
                    <div class="comp-col">
                        <strong>🛡️ Simple Shield (Free)</strong>
                        <p>Apply a lightweight noise pattern. It's fast and runs on basic servers. Good for casual social media privacy.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comp-col pro">
                        <strong>⚔️ Extreme Shield (Pro)</strong>
                        <p>
                            Uses massive GPU power (Graphics Processing Units). We simulate an enemy AI trying to attack your photo, 
                            calculate exactly where it is weak, and reinforce those pixels. 
                            <br><br>
                            <em>Why is it Pro?</em> This requires loading 4GB+ of AI models into memory and running complex calculus 
                            that costs significant electricity and server rental fees.

            <div class="step">
                <h3>3. Privacy First</h3>
                <p>We process your image in RAM (Temporary Memory). Once the "shield" is applied and sent back to you, the original is instantly deleted. We never use your photos to train AI.</p>
